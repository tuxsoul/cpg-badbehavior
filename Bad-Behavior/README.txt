malicious accesses to your PHP-based Web site. It prevents comment spam,
trackback spam, guestbook spam, wiki spam, referrer spam, and some types
of malicious Web site hacking.

*Warning*: If you are upgrading from a 1.x.x version of Bad Behavior,
you must remove it from your system entirely, and delete all of its

== Release Notes ==

= Bad Behavior 2.0 Known Issues =

* Bad Behavior may be unable to protect cached pages on MediaWiki.

* On WordPress when using WordPress Advanced Cache (WP-Cache), Bad Behavior
requires a patch to WP-Cache 2 in order to protect cached pages.

  Edit the wp-content/plugins/wp-cache/wp-cache-phase1.php file and find the
following two lines at around line 32:

`	if (! ($meta = unserialize(@file_get_contents($meta_pathname))) )
		return;`

  Immediately after this, insert the following line:

`	require_once( ABSPATH .  'wp-content/plugins/Bad-Behavior/bad-behavior-generic.php');`

  Then visit your site. Everything should work normally, but spammers will
not be able to access your cached pages either.
